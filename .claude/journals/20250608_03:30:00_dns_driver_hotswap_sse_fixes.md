# DNS Driver Hot-Swapping and SSE Architecture Fixes

**Date:** June 8, 2025  
**Time:** 03:30:00  
**Session Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Complexity:** High

## Session Overview

This session focused on fixing critical issues with DNS driver management, error handling, and SSE (Server-Sent Events) architecture. The main problems were blank pages on API errors, inefficient server restarts during driver changes, and SSE interference between real-time streams and historical data.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Driver Hot-Swapping Architecture ✅

**Problem:** Driver changes were triggering unnecessary DNS server restarts, causing service interruption and blank pages.

**Root Cause:** The API was using server restart logic even for driver changes that didn't require it.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `getServerInstance()` method to DNS manager
- Replaced server restart with hot-swapping using existing methods:
  - `server.setLogDriver()`
  - `server.setCacheDriver()`
  - `server.setBlacklistDriver()`
  - `server.setWhitelistDriver()`
- Eliminated service downtime during driver changes

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Before (causing restarts)
await dnsManager.stop();
await dnsManager.start();

// After (hot-swapping)
const server = dnsManager.getServerInstance();
server.setLogDriver(newDriverInstance);
```

### 2. Comprehensive API Error Handling ✅

**Problem:** Non-200 API responses were causing blank pages instead of proper error notifications.

**Root Cause:** Multiple issues:
- Uncaught errors from `throw new Error()` statements
- Missing `response.ok` checks before JSON parsing
- Lack of proper error boundaries

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### A. Fixed All API Error Handling
- Added `response.ok` checks to all API calls
- Replaced `throw new Error()` with Snackbar notifications
- Enhanced error message extraction from API responses

#### B. Added React ErrorBoundary
- Created comprehensive ErrorBoundary component
- Added to Dashboard layout for debugging
- Provides stack traces and recovery options

#### C. Updated Both Stores
- **dnsStore.ts:** Fixed `startServer`, `stopServer`, `toggleServer`, `fetchStatus`, `fetchConfig`
- **driverStore.ts:** Fixed `fetchDrivers`, `getDriverContent`, `setDriver`

### 3. Fixed SSE Architecture Issues ✅

**Problem:** SSE events were interfering between real-time logs and historical data, causing resets instead of appends.

**Root Cause:** Two SSE systems were conflicting:
- LogsDriver's direct SSE for real-time streams
- Driver store SSE for bulk driver updates

**Solution:**
- Separated concerns: Driver store SSE skips automatic logs updates
- LogsDriver handles real-time stream via direct SSE connection
- Manual refresh button uses separate API calls for history

**Architecture:**
```
Real-time Stream (Stream Tab):
├── Direct SSE: /api/dns/events (log_event)
├── Appends to logs state array
└── No interference from driver store

History Data (History Tab):
├── Manual refresh button
├── Calls getDriverContent() API
└── Updates driverContent store
```

### 4. Fixed Driver Name Resolution ✅

**Problem:** API was returning `"driver": "unknown"` instead of actual driver names.

**Root Cause:** API was accessing server status instead of actual server instance for driver information.

**Solution:**
- Updated both `getDriverContent()` and `getCurrentDriverStatus()` functions
- Use actual server instance: `dnsManager.getServerInstance().drivers`
- Instead of status object: `dnsManager.getStatus().server.drivers` (boolean flags)

### 5. Enhanced UI Components ✅

#### A. Improved Driver Name Display
- Created `formatDriverName()` function for proper capitalization
- Fixed "Inmemory" → "InMemory", "Sqlite" → "SQLite"

#### B. Added Clear All Logs Feature
- Clear button positioned outside tabs (affects both stream and history)
- Confirmation dialog with destructive action warning
- Clears both real-time and persistent log data

#### C. Improved Visual Design
- Changed refresh button from gray to green/blue (primary variant)
- Added red styling for destructive clear button
- Better visual hierarchy and user feedback

### 6. Data Type Safety Fixes ✅

**Problem:** Log data from API had string timestamps but UI expected Date objects.

**Solution:**
- Added timestamp conversion in LogsDriver component
- Safe type checking for driver content (array vs string)
- Error boundaries to catch any remaining type mismatches

## Technical Details

### API Endpoint Changes

**Driver Hot-Swap Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "logs driver successfully changed to inmemory",
  "scope": "logs", 
  "driver": "inmemory",
  "hotSwapped": true,        // New field
  "serverRunning": true      // Instead of serverRestarted
}
```

### Error Handling Pattern

**Standardized across all API calls:**
```typescript
if (!response.ok) {
  let errorMessage = 'Default error message';
  try {
    const errorData = await response.json();
    if (errorData.error) {
      errorMessage = errorData.error;
      // Special handling for specific errors (e.g., EADDRINUSE)
    }
  } catch {
    errorMessage = `HTTP ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`;
  }
  useSnackbarStore.getState().showAlert(errorMessage, 'Error Title');
  return;
}
```

### SSE Data Flow

**Before (Problematic):**
```
SSE Event → Driver Store → History Update → UI Reset
```

**After (Fixed):**
```
Real-time: SSE Event → LogsDriver → Stream Append
History: Manual Refresh → API Call → History Update
```

## Files Modified

### Core Architecture
- `src/dns/manager.ts` - Added `getServerInstance()` method
- `src/api/dns/driver.ts` - Hot-swap logic, error handling, driver name resolution

### Frontend Stores

- `src/app/dashboard/DashboardApp.tsx` - Added ErrorBoundary wrapper

## Performance Improvements

1. **Zero-downtime driver changes** - No more server restarts
2. **Reduced SSE conflicts** - Separated real-time and historical data flows  
3. **Better error recovery** - Graceful degradation instead of crashes
4. **Improved user feedback** - Snackbar notifications instead of blank pages
