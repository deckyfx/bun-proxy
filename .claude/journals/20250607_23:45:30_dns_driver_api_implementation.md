# DNS Driver API Implementation Session
**Date:** December 7, 2025, 23:45:30  
**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Scope:** Backend DNS driver API, Frontend integration, Component refactoring

## Session Overview
This session focused on implementing a comprehensive DNS driver management system, including backend API endpoints, frontend state management, and UI component refactoring for better maintainability.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. DNS Driver API Implementation
- **Created `/api/dns/driver` endpoint** with GET and POST methods
- **GET endpoint** returns current driver configuration and available drivers
- **POST endpoint** handles two methods:
  - `SET`: Override driver configuration (placeholder implementation)
  - `GET`: Retrieve driver content with filtering options

### 2. Driver System Enhancement
- **Added static `DRIVER_NAME` constants** to all driver classes:
  - Console, InMemory, File, SQLite drivers across logs, cache, blacklist, whitelist
- **Enhanced DNS Manager** with default driver configuration and state persistence
- **Fixed driver fallback logic** to return proper defaults when server is down

### 3. Type System & Shared State
- **Created shared types** in `src/types/driver.ts` for API consistency
- **Implemented Zustand driver store** with methods:
  - `fetchDrivers()` - Get current and available drivers
  - `getDriverContent()` - Retrieve driver-specific content
  - `setDriver()` - Update driver configuration
- **Integrated shared state** across components using DNS and driver stores

### 4. Frontend Component Architecture
- **Split DNS page into specialized components**:
  - `DNSControl.tsx` - Server start/stop, port configuration
  - `DNSConfig.tsx` - NextDNS settings, whitelist configuration  
  - `DNSDriver.tsx` - Driver selection and management
- **Refactored main DNS.tsx** from 421 lines to 46 lines
- **Implemented automatic polling** for driver content when server is running

### 5. API Testing & Validation
- **Created comprehensive test suite** with JSON response files
- **Generated `report.txt`** documenting API functionality and issues
- **Verified driver defaults**: Logs=Console, Cache/Blacklist/Whitelist=InMemory

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints Added
```typescript
GET /api/dns/driver
POST /api/dns/driver
```

### Driver Configuration Flow
1. Server defaults: Console for logs, InMemory for others
2. API returns current configuration even when server is down
3. Driver forms pre-populate with current/default values
4. Auto-polling refreshes content every 10 seconds when server active

### Component Architecture
```
DNS.tsx (orchestrator)
├── DNSControl.tsx (server management)
├── DNSConfig.tsx (NextDNS settings)
└── DNSDriver.tsx (driver management)
```

### State Management
- **DNS Store**: Port, NextDNS config, server status, whitelist settings
- **Driver Store**: Current drivers, available options, content polling

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `src/types/driver.ts` - Shared driver types
- `src/api/dns/driver.ts` - Driver API endpoints
- `src/app/stores/driverStore.ts` - Driver state management
- `src/app/dashboard/pages/dns/DNSControl.tsx` - Server control component
- `src/app/dashboard/pages/dns/DNSConfig.tsx` - Configuration component  
- `src/app/dashboard/pages/dns/DNSDriver.tsx` - Driver management component
- Test files: `get_driver_test.json`, `logs_test.json`, `cache_test.json`, `set_driver_test.json`
- `report.txt` - API testing documentation

### Modified Files
- `src/dns/manager.ts` - Added default drivers and state persistence
- `src/dns/server.ts` - Enhanced driver initialization
- `src/api/dns/index.ts` - Added driver route exports
- `src/app/dashboard/pages/DNS.tsx` - Complete refactor to use split components
- All driver classes - Added static `DRIVER_NAME` constants
- `src/types/index.ts` - Added driver types export

## Current State & Next Steps

### Working Features
✅ DNS driver API endpoints functional  
✅ Driver store integration complete  
✅ Component splitting successful  
✅ Shared state management working  
✅ Auto-polling for driver content  
✅ Default driver configuration  

### Known Issues
⚠️ Driver SET method returns "not yet implemented"  
⚠️ Driver content retrieval shows placeholder messages  
⚠️ Content tables are placeholder implementations  

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Implement actual driver switching logic** in SET method
2. **Add real content methods** to driver base classes (`getLogs()`, `getAll()`)
3. **Build content table components** for each driver type
4. **Add driver configuration persistence** across server restarts
5. **Implement filtering/pagination** for driver content
6. **Add driver performance metrics** and monitoring

## Architecture Notes
The implementation follows a clean separation of concerns:
- **API layer** handles HTTP requests and driver operations
- **Store layer** manages state and provides reactive updates  
- **Component layer** focuses on UI and user interactions
- **Type layer** ensures consistency across frontend/backend

The driver system is now extensible and ready for additional driver implementations or enhanced functionality.

## Code Quality
- All TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Proper error handling throughout the system  
- Consistent naming conventions and code structure
- Comprehensive type safety with shared interfaces
- Clean component architecture with minimal coupling

This session established a solid foundation for DNS driver management that can be extended in future development cycles.
